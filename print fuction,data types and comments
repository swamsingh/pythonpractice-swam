#as you can see when i print hello and world in sepratre line why they print seprated bcz there a alreDY built 
#function in the system that is /n if we want to end this just simply use end= ''
print('hello', end=' ')
print( 'world')
hello world

#see
# now 
print('name','om','ankit',1234)
name om ankit 1234
ystem 
# as you seeing that when i print the code it gives space btw the words why but i gave , 
#so this happen bcz of a sep function that is also assigned in system

g btw thwm that we want 
#see we can give anything btw thwm that we want 
# data types in python
#basically in python datatypes are categories in 3 these are:
#basic(int,float,bolean,string)
#container type(list,tuple,dict,sets)
#user defined( class)
#
#
ut it print all the same way 
#basic data ty
#int
print(9)
#and the maximum number int can store is 
print(1e308)
#if i write 1e309 or above it shows infinite
​
#float
print(9.3)
#and the maximum number float can store is
print(1.7e308)
​
#bolean
print(True)
print(False)
#and if i write True like (true) tihs its show error bcz system not avable to recognise it
​
#string
print('Om',end=' ')
print("Singh",end=' ')
print("""Tomer""")
# as you can see i single ' ' then double " " and """ """ but it print all the same way 
9
1e+308

True
False
Om Singh Tomer
#CONTAINER type they called cointer type bcz they store values in them like conatiner store 
​
#list
print([1,2,3,4,])
#list is just a array but in python we name it list in another language it is array
​
#tuple
print(( 12,23,43,234))
​
#sets
print({122,23,2324})
​
#dict or dictionary
print({'NAME':'OM','AGE':19,"percent":81.83})
#in dic we make key value pairs

#comments
# comments are that part that were not execiute by compiler and inter preter
#but in is not an error 
#we give comments in our code to increse it readeballity
# in it industrie we work in teams on big projects so if i stop somewher so my comments helps 
#my teamests and collegs to know the logic and the work of code where i stop
# in python we use # to comment a line but python does not have multi line comment system like 
# other languages have
