# today's topic is variables 
#in any other lang we need to declare the variable first 
#ex in clang
# int a = 5
# in python we not need this bcz python is smart enough

name = 'om'
a = 5
print(name,a)

#there were no variable declaration in python this is called DYNAMIC typing 

name = 'om'
print (name)

name = 4
print(name)

#in above line as you seeing that i changed the value of name 2 times 
#if we in c we cant do that 
#this phenimena in python is called dynamic binding

#special syntex 
a=1;b=3;c=7
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

a,b,c=1,3,7
print(a,b,c)

a,b,c=1,3,7
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

a='om';b=19;c=89.37
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)



# keywords


import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)

#python is a case sensitive prog lang
#in above you see some keywords there
#remeber one thing that never name your variable by a keyword 
#it increase the chane of erroe 

# identifiyers

#a python identifiesr is a name to identify a variable ,class fun, and object
#we name identifier by using alphabet or _ only
#identifers keyword nahi rkhne chaiye
