What are Python's key features?

High-level, interpreted, and dynamically typed language.
Supports object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.
Extensive standard library and third-party packages.
Platform-independent and easy to learn.
Explain Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock).
The GIL ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time, even on multi-core systems. It simplifies memory management but limits true parallel execution of threads.

Differentiate between deepcopy() and copy().

copy(): Creates a shallow copy (references nested objects).
deepcopy(): Creates a deep copy (recursively copies all objects).
What are Python decorators?
Functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods by wrapping them, typically using the @decorator syntax.

How does Python handle memory management?
Python uses automatic memory management with garbage collection to free unused objects, along with reference counting for memory allocation.

What is a lambda function?
An anonymous, single-expression function defined using the lambda keyword.
Example: lambda x, y: x + y.

Explain list comprehension.
A concise way to create lists.
Example: [x**2 for x in range(5)] outputs [0, 1, 4, 9, 16].

What is the difference between is and == in Python?

is: Checks if two objects reference the same memory location.
==: Checks if the values of two objects are equal.
What are Pythonâ€™s mutable and immutable data types?

Mutable: Lists, dictionaries, sets.
Immutable: Strings, tuples, numbers.
Explain Python's exception hierarchy.
Built-in exceptions are organized hierarchically with BaseException at the top. Common ones include Exception, ValueError, KeyError, TypeError, etc.
