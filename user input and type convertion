# taking user input

# user input llows developres to take information or data from the user
#which can we assign to a variable 
# like in c++ lanf we use cin , in java systemin ,in c scanf 
# in python we use input() to take user input 


input('heyy my name is ')

fir_num = input("enter first number")
sec_num = input("enter second number")

print(fir_num)
print(sec_num)

result= fir_num + sec_num
print(result)

#as you in above result the logic is correct but it cancat them not add them why
#this happen bcz there a input property in python in which it take all inputs in string value
#so we need to give the input type when we giving input 

# so to solve this problem we use type convertion in our code


#what is type convertion
#simply type convertion is process converting one data type into  another 
#data type
#ther were two type of convertion
#implicit
#explicit

#implicit
4+5.5

4+5+7j

#explicit
fir_num+sec_num

#we use built in function in explicit type conversions
#like int , float , list etc

int(4.5)

float(4)

list('hello')

# and here a note that type conversion is not a permanet opretion like type castinf in other 
#lang

a =4.4

int(a)

print(a)


fir_num = input("enter first number")
sec_num = input("enter second number")
result= int(fir_num )+ int(sec_num)
print(result)

#but you eritw this code in this way
fir_num = int(input("enter first number"))
sec_num = int(input("enter second number"))
result= fir_num + sec_num
print(result)
#in thi way we not need to give data type everytime

#we can use type function in python to know the what type of data it is
#type()
type(4)

type(234.34)

type([1,2,3,4])
